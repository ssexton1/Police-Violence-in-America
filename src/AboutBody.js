                The prejudices held by people in power have shaped the systemic racism prevalent in the
                US today. One of the major implications of this is police brutality against historically
                oppressed or marginalized groups. However, the majority of these victims have been
                African American. The term police brutality is generally defined as unwarranted or
                excessive use of force against civilians by police officers. These actions range from
                assault to torture and murder.

                Police violence is often linked to systemic racial inequalities and economic
                class divisions, many of which have been formed back in the era of slavery and
                colonialism. Additionally, the institutional culture of police departments encouraged
                a “show of force” approach to any perceived challenge to an officer’s authority.
                As a result, policing and criminalization have been prioritized as primary state
                responses to a range of societal problems.

                On May 25, the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota sparked a major
                protest movement after similar high-profile killings of unarmed Black people by the
                police occurred. Hundreds of protests broke across the US, calling for the government
                to end systemic racism and police violence by reducing police department budgets and
                investing in basic community needs. While protesters have marched peacefully,
                many were beat up, arrested, and shot with rubber bullets by police officers after
                curfew went effect during the protests. In addition to these protests, grassroots
                activist groups dedicated to police and prison abolition are organizing mutual aid
                projects to support Black communities and other reform methods to address the issue.
